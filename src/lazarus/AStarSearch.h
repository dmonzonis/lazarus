 * Implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.

 * reliably if the heuristic never overestimates the actual distance of an optimal path
 * from any node to the goal node.

 * @tparam Position The type of position. Must implement the operators `==`, `!=` and `<`.
 * @tparam Map THe type of map that the algorithm will use. Must implement the methods
 * `get_cost(const Position&)` and `neighbours(const Position&)`.
